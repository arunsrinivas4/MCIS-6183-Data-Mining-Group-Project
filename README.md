Project Proposal
Customary spatial queries, for example, such that extend look What's more closest neighbor retrieval, include best states once objects’ geometric properties. Today, numerous cutting edge provisions call for novel types of queries that point should discover Questions fulfilling both a spatial predicate, Furthermore a predicate for their connected writings. For example, As opposed to recognizing every last one of restaurants, a closest neighbor inquiry might rather request those restaurant that is those closest around the individuals whose menus hold “steak, spaghetti, brandy” everyone in those same period. Currently, the best answer for such queries will be In light of those IR2-tree, which, likewise demonstrated in this paper, need a couple deficiencies that genuinely sway its effectiveness. Spurred Toward this, we create another right technique known as those spatial altered list that extends those customary altered list on adapt to multidimensional data, Also hails for calculations that might reply closest neighbor queries for keywords progressively. Concerning illustration checked Eventually Tom's perusing experiments, the recommended systems beat those IR2-tree done inquiry reaction time significantly, regularly Eventually Tom's perusing an element for requests from claiming extent.

Overview: 
Here we will be be doing analysis on finding nearest restaurants or super-markets. User reviews will be either positive or negative opinions. These reviews will be helpful in updating application accordingly. 

Datasets: 
	The datasets for this analysis will be the list of all the restaurants or super-markets.
